# machine-learning

## ðŸ“‘ Description

### Model #1

The first model to predict common skin diseases in Indonesia such as:
Biduran, Bisul, Cacar Air, Jerawat, Kurap, dan Panu.

### Model #2

The second model is to provide recommendations for medicine or ointment for predicted skin diseases. This recommendation contains:
recommendations for medicine/ointment, how to use it, and how to treat the skin disease.

## ðŸ“š Libraries Used

This project utilizes several Python libraries for data handling, machine learning, and visualization:
